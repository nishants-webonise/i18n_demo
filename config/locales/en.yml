  title: "The GeekHours Project"
  first_para: "The global development team at Webonise is always coming up with creative and innovative ideas to have fun while learning about the quickly growing field we work in. The GeekHours project is a product of that thought process. This was the perfect way to  give Webonisers a coding platform, an event where they can sit together and enjoy their very own lines of code. An 18-hour coding and designing marathon, GeekHours was the place to build out the cool app you have been thinking about. Because, yes, sometimes your nine-to-five sometimes translates into your nine-to-ten and you end up in a circle of creative frustration. So the idea for GeekHours  was to basically spend quality time doing the things you always wanted to do but never got around to doing- work on that piece of code that you wanted to write, a framework that you wanted to design or even an app idea that you've always wanted to develop from scratch."
  second_para: "Also, GeekHours gave us the opportunity to try out job roles we didn’t normally do. During those 18 hours each participant was in charge of everything from project management, to idea implementation to resource channeling. A creative break to the sometimes repetitive daily activities. One developer actually told us that after the event she had the confidence to independently work in any job, on any project. So yes, we’re glad to have come up with this idea. It’s coding. It’s coffee. It’s fun. It’s people sitting together and working as team, focusing on building something together. Your proverbial working playground."
